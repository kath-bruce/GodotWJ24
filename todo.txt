TODO

*map generation
	- *draw a river to nearest mountain (that does not have a river associated already) from each lake/lake cluster
	- named features (with accompanying text on map)
	- add bog tiles adj to river tiles
	- *make sure there is a route back home (starting point will be in centre of one quadrant, home will be opposite edge/corner of map - secrets "behind" player, possible "quest" items i.e., things needed to barter with tribes for specific things)
		- if river or lakes block route make sure there is a suitable tribe that player can bargain with in order to cross lakes and rivers or even just some equipment somewhere along river, maybe player is forced to decide who goes with them from party but how would i detect that? maybe just mark that equipment spawned?
		- if mountains block route home, just change one to hills
	- *add tribes and paint tribelands onto map (maybe partly based on terrain)
		- tribe relationships (allied, positive, neutral, negative, hostile) - maybe way to adjust difficulty
	- *add villages
	
add compass to map hud (will be a static image)

fog of war and los - not strictly essential, nice to have but zoom level can act as los/fog of war limitation

*player and player movement
	- *resource/need depletion on movement
	- *day/night cycle
	- making camps and resting
	- random encounters
		- combat
	- move counter?
	- party conversation barks
	- *(if combat implemented) injuries (decreases hp)
	- buffs and debuffs?
	- *needs
		- warmth
		- thirst
		- hunger
		
combat
	- with both animals and raiders
	- realtime
	- somewhat automatic
	- only occurs in melee range and enemy is not in a trap
	- maybe like the combat in sims medieval?
		- choose general approach, can issue some commands, some rng but mostly equipment based?, basically a war of attrition
		- has the tempo and narrative, almost, of a boxing match
		
*tribes - all tribes can gather and trade, tribes can make different things
	- mountain tribe (can traverse mountains)
	- river tribe (can cross rivers + lakes)
	- forest tribe (can make traps and hunt for food)
	- islander tribe?  (can dive and fish for food)
		- would have to amend map generation for oceans and islands to occur (maybe around the edges?)
	- cave tribe (can mine and craft intricate items)
	- hill tribe (can make potions)
	- raiders (tribeless and hostile)
	- wanderers and hermits (tribeless and neutral)

*action menu on hex
	- contextual dependent
	- possible actions based on what tribes are in your party
	- *needs/resources improve

*village interaction
	- choice menu
		- trade
		- ask for directions to home, other tribal villages, named features
	- quests to recruit a someone from a tribe
		- maybe have to live in village (spend certain amount of time within village limits) for given amount of time
		- get x amount of resource that another tribe has
		- hunt/trap a mythical beast
		- find missing person
		- find artefact
		- heal a village elder
		- craft something worth x amount of resources

*pop ups

	- *party members
		- back story, name, *tribe (only one allowed per tribe in your party, as only one needed)
	- *DOG
	- *inventory
	- equipment (can just flags set on party)
	- actions on party members (converse, *pet dog)
	- *accompanying ui screens
	- *(if combat implemented) injuries (decreases hp)
	- buffs and debuffs?
	- relationships (maybe just with player - but possible to expand to relationships with other party members)
		- decreases if needs neglected, if travelling with hostile tribe in party - may 
	- *party members have needs as well

world map (possibly manually chartered a la long dark)
