TODO

*map generation
	- *draw a river to nearest mountain (that does not have a river associated already) from each lake/lake cluster
	- named features (with accompanying text on map)
	- add bog tiles adj to river tiles
	- *make sure there is a route back home (starting point will be in centre of one quadrant, home will be opposite edge/corner of map - secrets "behind" player, possible "quest" items i.e., things needed to barter with tribes for specific things)
		- if river or lakes block route make sure there is a suitable tribe that player can bargain with in order to cross lakes and rivers or even just some equipment somewhere along river, maybe player is forced to decide who goes with them from party but how would i detect that? maybe just mark that equipment spawned?
		- if mountains block route home, just change one to hills
	- *add tribes and paint tribelands onto map (maybe partly based on terrain)
		- tribe relationships (allied, positive, neutral, negative, hostile) - maybe way to adjust difficulty
	- *add villages
