family - pet the dog, secret passage, passage of time (not doing the quippy narrator)

i think i like the whole "young person trying to find their way back home to their family" better

pick a starting tribe - that tribe home will be the opposite side of the map

need to survive between intermediate villages - you need enough things to barter with villages to get directions to next village, to safely stay at the village

first can only forage for berries, then can fish, then can defend yourself against wild animals, then can hunt

or maybe can only do one of these things depending on starting tribe, need to get people from other tribes to do other things

this can be a prototype for the slayers guild game

this isn't going to be a very deep simulation like unreal world 

TODO

- hexmap generation
- player of given tribe moving between hexes
- hexes have different terrain and features (so different possible actions)
- action menu on tile
- villages and interactions with them
- other tribespeople in your party (with new accompanying possible actions)
- needs depleting on movement
- needs fulfilling on actions
- special things to find - gives abilities/buffs/effects and used to barter
- animal attacks (combat)
- party member actions
- triggering scenarios (party member is missing, party member is hurt)
- inventory system
- equipment system?
- win and lose states
- party member have back stories
